.SH NAME
avocadodump - a tool to create logical dumps of an AvocadoDB database
.SH SYNOPSIS
avocadodump [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The avocadodump binary can be used to create logical dumps of collection
meta information and collection data (documents) of an AvocadoDB database.
By default, all non-system collections of the specified AvocadoDB database
will be dumped with structural information and data. 

For each collection, a file named "<collection>.structure.json" will be
created with information about the collection. When data is also dumped,
an additional file "<collection>.data.json" will also be created.
All dump files will be placed in a directory, which will be created by
avocadodump when run. If the directory already exists, avocadodump will refuse to
work unless started with the option "--overwrite true".

avocadodump will work on the specified database only. If no database name
is specified, avocadodump will work on the default database ("_system").

The dumped files can be re-stored in an AvocadoDB database using the
avocadorestore tool.
.SH OPTIONS
The avocadodump binary has many options that can be used to control its
behavior.  For a complete list of options, please refer to the
AvocadoDB online manual, available at https://www.avocadodb.com/
