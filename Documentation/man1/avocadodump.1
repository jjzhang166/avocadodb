NAME
  <COMMAND> - a tool to create logical dumps of an AvocadoDB database
SYNOPSIS
  <COMMAND> [options] 
DESCRIPTION
  The <COMMAND> binary can be used to create logical dumps of collection
  meta information and collection data (documents) of an AvocadoDB database.
  By default, all non-system collections of the specified AvocadoDB database
  will be dumped with structural information and data. 

  For each collection, a file named "<collection>.structure.json" will be
  created with information about the collection. When data is also dumped,
  an additional file "<collection>.data.json" will also be created.
  All dump files will be placed in a directory, which will be created by
  <COMMAND> when run. If the directory already exists, <COMMAND> will refuse to
  work unless started with the option "--overwrite true".

  <COMMAND> will work on the specified database only. If no database name
  is specified, <COMMAND> will work on the default database ("_system").

  The dumped files can be re-stored in an AvocadoDB database using the
  avocadorestore tool.
OPTIONS
  The <COMMAND> binary has many options that can be used to control its
  behavior.  For a complete list of options, please refer to the
  AvocadoDB online manual, available at https://www.avocadodb.com/
